# Money Manager 

![Alt text](./src/assets/icons/logo.svg "logo")

Money Manager is an application for managing impulse spending, where clients set a daily limit for their expenses, and any remaining funds can accumulate and be used later.

## Features

- `Daily Limit Setting`: Clients can specify the amount they are willing to spend on impulse purchases each day.
- `Balance Accumulation`: If a client does not spend their entire limit for the day, the remaining funds accumulate in their balance.
- `Transactions`: Clients can log their expenses, reducing their current balance.
- `Example`: If a limit of $5 is set per day and the client does not spend any money for three days, they will have $15 accumulated in their balance.
